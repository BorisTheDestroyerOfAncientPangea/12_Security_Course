# 12 Security Course

***Hello!*** While not quite a course you can follow, a majority of this repository was written from a Youtube course about [Spring Security](https://youtu.be/her_7pa0vrg) by [Amigoscode](https://www.youtube.com/c/amigoscode/featured).

If you are interested in learning more about security after browsing the project, feel free to watch the aforementioned video!

## Description

- This project implements most of the key functionalities of *Spring Security*, applicable within your own Spring/Boot projects
- It covers the process of creating a standard Spring Boot application, following on with the required dependencies and packages needed to implement Spring Security features
- Prior to that, however, the base of the business logic and HTTP endpoints will have to be set according to the MVC pattern - meaning you will need to have adequate knowledge of other parts of Spring Boot before attempting to replicate this project

## Covered Topics

The *strictly security-focused* topics covered within this tutorial are:

- Basic Authentication
- Form-Based Authentication
- JWT Authentiaction
- CSRF
- Roles & Authorities
- Password Encoding with BCrypt

Of course, within each bracket there is much more to learn than what was just mentioned; a substantial amount left out entirely.

## Resources

- [Spring Boot Tutorial](https://youtu.be/9SGDpanrc8U) - A helpful tutorial for those not as well-acquainted with the Spring Boot framework (from the same creator)
- [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) - A tool that allows you to create and configure a Spring Boot project easily

## Notes

The course in question is almost ***5 hours*** in runtime and is split up into 3 main parts, so make sure to allocate enough time to fully understand what is being taughtâ˜º
